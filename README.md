# Advent of Code solutions
My solutions to Advent of Code, an annual contest held at https://adventofcode.com. I am primarily solving in Python, with the aim of gaining understanding and experience rather than taking on the leaderboard. (So far.)

To run a solution with imports from `utils`, you must be in repo's top-level folder and run `python -m <YEAR>.day<DAYNUM>`, e.g. `python -m 2024.day12`, with no file suffix at the end.
